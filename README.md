# Relationship_between_height_and_foot_size
A Study on the Relationship between Height andFootSize

Tasks
1) Data pre-processing: consolidate the two body height and shoe/foot size data files in one data file containing relevant attributes. The data may contain some imperfection that requires some data cleansing activities. Please describe these activities and provide necessary justifications and assumptions in the report.
2) What is the correlation between body height and foot size, and explain your results.
3) Create a histogram based on foot size values.
Requirements:
i) Figure title: “Foot Size Distribution”
ii) X-axis is labelled with “Foot Size in CM” or “Foot Size in EU Size”
iii) Y-axis is labelled with “Frequency”
iv) The bins should be coloured with hex colour code “#42f5b3”
4) Enhance the figure generated in 3)
i) Create a facet chart based on genders
ii) Provide descriptive descriptions and insights of the visualisations, not less than 200 words.
5) Create linear regression models of human body heights and shoe sizes for the entire population, female population and male population respectively. Generate plots of the models over the samples. Justify comprehensively your answer using the model summaries.
6)  Based on the results from 5) above, analyse the residuals to determine if the assumptions underlying your regression analysis are valid. You need to provide a visualisation for this purpose and justify your answer.
